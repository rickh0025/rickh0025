## Hi there 👋

## Rick Halder

### Who am I?

I am a research-oriented engineer with experience in building complete, real-world systems. My work focuses on the intersection of **AI/ML, mobile sensing, and system engineering**, with an emphasis on practical implementation and long-term impact.

### What have I worked on?

* Designed and built **mobile sensor–based intelligent systems**, including a smartphone-based pothole detection system
* Implemented **machine learning pipelines** for time-series data analysis
* Developed **cloud and MLOps workflows** for scalable model inference and data processing

### What am I currently learning?

* **FastAPI** for developing clean, production-ready ML backends
* Strengthening foundations in **applied ML systems**, with emphasis on **time-series modeling, system design, and deployment**, aligned with **research, startup execution, and industry roles**

### What tools do I use?

* **Android Development**: Kotlin, Java, device sensors, data collection
* **Machine Learning & Data**: Python, time-series modeling, inference pipelines
* * **Backend & Cloud**: FastAPI, **Azure** (used in production pipelines), cloud-based ML workflows, data engineering concepts

### How to reach me?

* GitHub: via this profile
* Professional links: available on my GitHub profile
